      <h1>How I Made a Website with AI</h1>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        In this post, Iâ€™m excited to share my journey of building a fully functional website with the help of AI. The process was a mix of brainstorming, tweaking, and lots of interaction with an AI assistant to get the design, layout, and functionality just right.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        I began by discussing my vision with the AI. I wanted a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and decided to use Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach. The AI helped me outline the structure of the site including a homepage, about page, blog, and contact page.

      <h2>Designing the Layout</h2>
      <p>
        Next, we worked on the layout. I wanted a clean and professional design. The AI provided me with sample code for a responsive layout featuring a navigation bar, a featured post, and multiple blog cards. We experimented with various layouts until I was satisfied.

      <h2>Adding Animations and Interactivity</h2>
      <p>
        To make the site feel modern and dynamic, I added animations using GSAP. The AI guided me through creating a subtle yet professional animation for the logo and a staggered fade-in effect for the blog post cards. This added a layer of interactivity that really brought the site to life.

      <h2>Final Touches</h2>
      <p>
        Once the layout and animations were in place, I refined the content and integrated social media links into the navigation and contact page. The entire process was iterative, with plenty of adjustments along the way.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Building this website with AI was both an exciting and enlightening experience. The guidance from the AI allowed me to experiment with different design ideas, animations, and functionalities quickly. If you're looking to streamline your website development process or just want to see how AI can assist in creative projects, I highly recommend giving it a try!
